                        I used to convert the

                <p>
                    That plus a little bit of JavaScript coding to extract information from the marker
                    data and add those as pop up text descriptions for the markers as well as put the whole thing
                    into a web accessible form.
                </p>

                <h2>Usage</h2>

                <p>
                    The code arranges that the map will initially be zoomed to the geographic
                    extent of all the marker locations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Markers that have not been clustered appear as blue bubbles - clicking one
                    of those will display a pop up of the marker's description. Markers that are in
                    close proximity to others will be clustered and colored to indicate the number
                    of markers at that location. Clicking on one of these will zoom the map to
                    enclose just those markers and expand the cluster into smaller clusters and
                    distinct markers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Markers may have either the names of distinct features as provided by Open
                    Street Map or, in cases where I created a marker in the middle of nowhere,
                    whatever I managed to type to describe that location.
                </p>

                    Select from a number of base maps using the layer chooser in the upper right corner.

                    Map Zoom levels can be manually controlled using the + and - controls in the upper left.
